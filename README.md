# Credit-Card-Fraud-ML

This project involves building and evaluating various machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.

-Dataset The dataset used in this project is creditcard.csv, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Data Exploration
-Load the dataset. -Display basic statistics and data structure. -Visualize class distribution. -Analyze fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. -Visualize the distribution of transaction time and amount. -Correlation heatmap.

Data Preprocessing
-Standardize the features. -Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

Model Training and Evaluation
-Train multiple models:  -XGBoost -Random Forest -CatBoost -LightGBM -Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. -Compare model performance.

-The dataset is provided by Kaggle. -Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM.
